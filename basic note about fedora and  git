10. Install Additional Desktop Environments

It is very easy to install other desktop environments in Fedora when you are running the GNOME version. The core is already installed for you, hence you can easily install the basic framework for other desktops.

For example, if you like to install KDE Plasma or XFCE desktop with Fedora 34 – you do not need to download and install the entire respective Fedora Spin .iso file. You can easily follow this method to install an additional desktop environment. Open a terminal and run the below commands.

First, run below to check the available environment package
 sudo dnf grouplist -v
Now you can install your favorite desktop using the name below.

sudo dnf install [environment name]
sudo dnf install @cinnamon-desktop-environment

Configure DNF for faster download

The dnf package manager provides various config options which help you to download faster or update your system faster. The configuration options are described here.

One of the options I would suggest is the max_parallel_downloads option. This takes a number from 3 to 20 – which means that many numbers package download can be done using dnf.

To do that, open the config file via below command and add the switch as below. 



sudo nano /etc/dnf/dnf.conf
max_parallel_downloads=10


sudo yum install neovim
sudo dnf install vim-enhanced
